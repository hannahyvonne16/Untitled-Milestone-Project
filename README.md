# Fountain: The Ultimate Toilet Finder

Have you ever been out and about exploring the city, on a road trip with your friends, or in a foreign country where you don't speak the local language, when suddenly, *bam* nature calls? Your heartbeat arises, panic takes over your body and your instincts push you to find a clean restroom. Rushing through the streets, you notice that there are no restroom signs in sight, your best bet is to aim for the bushes or find a scary dark alleyway to do your business, you might even have to sacrifice a sock. When all hope is lost, during the intense moments of confusion and regret for not using the restroom at home. You remember that your friend recommended a new app called "Fountain" which allows you to see local public restrooms. You download "Fountain", open the app, and quickly the beautifully designed UI and intuitive "plug and play," concept tell you there's a clean public restroom right around the corner. Full of relief, you do your business and slowly wash your hands, the only thought on your mind is: "Why didn't I download Fountain sooner?"  Welcome to the world of Fountain. 

Fountain was designed first and foremost with the user in mind. Our goal is to deliver an app that quickly tells the user, the location of nearby restrooms. Our plug-and-play concept comes from empathy: our users need a solution fast, and most apps take time too much time and effort to find a good place to do number 1 or 2. We created a functional, intuitive, beautifully designed app that takes the complexity of other apps and provides the user with simplicity in times of great stress.
